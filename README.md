**Abstract**

We enumerate all non-isomorphic simple undirected graphs on _n_ nodes. We calculate their degree distributions and find sets of graphs that have the same histogram (equivalence classes). We show that histograms uniquely determine graphs for _n=2,3,4_. We find the first ambiguous cases of non-isomorphic graphs with the same histogram for _n=5_, and show they are homeomorphic (topologically equivalent). We then find many graphs for _n=6_ that have the same histogram, but are topologically distinct.
